# Challenge2

For this challenge we were tasked with setting up a website showcasing our skills. Since I do cat sitting on the side of my full-time job and I don't as yet have much to show from development, I chose to build a website advertising my cat sitting. 

Below I've listed the acceptance criteria we were given. 

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
